I pursued my PhD at IT University of Copenhagen with main 
supervisor Marco Carbone and co-supervisor Jesper Bengtson.
During my PhD I mechanised subject reduction and communication safety,
based on their formulation in Honda et al. [1]. This was carried out
in the Coq Proof Assistant. The thesis can be found
[here](/assets/thesis.pdf) and links for developments are provided 
below.

## Publications 
* A sound and Complete Projection for Global Types publised in the
Interactive Theorem Proving conference in 2023

## Theses
* MSc thesis: A Propositional Calculus for Contract Specification 
  [pdf](/assets/report.pdf) [code](https://github.com/Tirore96/csl_derivatives)
* PhD thesis: A Mechanisation of Multiparty Session Types [pdf](/assets/thesis.pdf)


## Projects in Coq
